## Technical Architecture

### Unified Runtime

The service combines Semantic Kernel and AutoGen to provide a consistent development experience:

```csharp
// Example: Creating an agent with Semantic Kernel
var kernel = Kernel.CreateBuilder()
    .AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion("gpt-4", endpoint, apiKey)
    .Build();

var agent = new AgentBuilder(kernel)
    .WithPlugin(new KnowledgePlugin())
    .WithMemory(new CosmosDBMemory(connectionString))
    .Build();
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Support for complex agent interactions and workflows:

```csharp
// Example: Multi-agent workflow
var workflow = new AgentWorkflow()
    .AddAgent("data-processor", dataProcessorAgent)
    .AddAgent("analyzer", analysisAgent)
    .AddAgent("decision-maker", decisionAgent)
    .Connect("data-processor", "analyzer")
    .Connect("analyzer", "decision-maker");
```

### Knowledge Integration

Seamless connection with various data sources:

```csharp
// Example: SharePoint integration
var sharePointConnector = new SharePointConnector(siteUrl, credentials);
var knowledgeAgent = new KnowledgeAgent(sharePointConnector);

// Example: Databricks integration
var databricksConnector = new DatabricksConnector(workspaceUrl, token);
var dataAgent = new DataAgent(databricksConnector);
```
